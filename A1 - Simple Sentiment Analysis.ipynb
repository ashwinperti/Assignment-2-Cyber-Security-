    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a **recurrent neural network** (RNN) as they are commonly used in analysing sequences. An RNN takes in sequence of words, $X=\\{x_1, ..., x_T\\}$, one at a time, and produces a _hidden state_, $h$, for each word. We use the RNN _recurrently_ by feeding in the current word $x_t$ as well as the hidden state from the previous word, $h_{t-1}$, to produce the next hidden state, $h_t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our final hidden state, $h_T$, (from feeding in the last word in the sequence, $x_T$) we feed it through a linear layer, $f$, (also known as a fully connected layer), to receive our predicted sentiment, $\\hat{y} = f(h_T)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below shows an example sentence, with the RNN predicting zero, which indicates a negative sentiment. The RNN is shown in orange and the linear layer shown in silver. Note that we use the same RNN for every word, i.e. it has the same parameters. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is a tensor initialized to all zeros. \n",

    "## Preparing Data\n",

    "\n",
    "We use the `TEXT` field to define how the review should be processed, and the `LABEL` field to process the sentiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our `TEXT` field has `tokenize='spacy'` as an argument. This defines that the \"tokenization\" (the act of splitting the string into discrete \"tokens\") should be done using the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) tokenizer. If no `tokenize` argument is passed, the default is simply splitting the string on spaces.\n",

    "`LABEL` is defined by a `LabelField`, a special subset of the `Field` class specifically used for handling labels. We will explain the `dtype` argument later.\n",
